The API keys for this project have been removed. In order to get this project to work, you will need to create a PHP 'keys.php' file in the root directory of the project to be included in both the 'index.php' and 'detail.php' pages. This allows access to the Parse Framework database.

We are currently working on our new website for WWDCScholars. We have bold plans this year including consolidating all the previous batches of scholars known as WWDCStudents and add in the upcoming scholars of 2016.

If you are a previous WWDCScholar or WWDCStudents and wants to contribute to the website, chat with us on  [![Join the chat!](https://img.shields.io/badge/WWDCScholars-JOIN%20CHAT-604887.svg)](https://gitter.im/WWDCScholars/WWDCScholarsHQ)
