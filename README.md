WWDCScholars is a community of [Apple WWDC Scholarship](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/scholarships/) winners. Every year bright minds from all around the world compete against each other for a free ticket to Apple's yearly developers conference. The scholarship recipients share their winning projects in [our iOS App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scholars-of-wwdc/id999731893?mt=8) and on [our website (wwdcscholars.com)](https://wwdcscholars.com).

This repository contains the [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) based website that lists current and previous scholarship winners from all around the world.

**Work in progress**
